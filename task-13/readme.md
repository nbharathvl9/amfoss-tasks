It was the simplest task. I followed the instructions and went through the steps they provided. At the end, I encountered a hiccup because I assumed my work was saved, but it wasn't. So, I ended up redoing the task. Nonetheless, it was a worthwhile experience. I learned to navigate and edit files in a terminal more smoothly and efficiently. I think I'll practice a bit more—it’ll be impressive to show off these skills to my friends and family.
