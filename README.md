## SELF INTRO

Hello, I'm Bharath, a freshman in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I'm deeply passionate about solving problems and thrive on tackling difficult challenges. Quick comprehension and resolute determination are among my key strengths; I persistently work through problems until I arrive at a solution. I look forward to furthering my knowledge and skills in my chosen field.
## INTROSPECTION

### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME
You should consider me for my steadfast commitment to excellence and unyielding determination. I'm not one to easily back down, always pushing myself to forge the best version possible. It may sometimes take me longer to accomplish tasks, but that's due to my thorough approach in striving for the best results. I thrive when facing tough challenges and excel in team settings, utilizing my strong collaborative abilities. My desire to learn is boundless—I continuously seek new learning opportunities, and am especially attracted to the resources and possibilities offered by amfoss. Joining your club would not only fulfill my intellectual curiosity but also stretch my capabilities further. I am ready to tackle any hurdles and make significant contributions to our team’s success. Furthermore, I possess a quick aptitude for grasping complex scenarios and taking charge, which ensures effective problem-solving and decision-making skills.

### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
My approach to contributing to the club centers around my relentless commitment to excellence. I believe in exceeding expectations and committing fully—giving more than 100% in all my endeavors. This fervent dedication will be evident in my contributions to the club. Whether it's offering support where necessary, applying my full range of skills to effectively contribute, or focusing on areas that need development, I am dedicated to making a substantive impact. My main goal is to identify and mitigate any shortcomings, leveraging my abilities and resources to bolster our collective efforts and achieve beneficial results for the club. You can count on my commitment to fully utilize my skills to make a meaningful contribution and ensure the club's success.

### DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
I'd like to provide some insights on the selection process. It’s crucial to recognize that many participants, myself included, are newcomers to coding and the broader technical realm. Some might even lack fundamental computer skills, which presents a significant barrier. Although I have a solid background in MPC, I am essentially beginning anew with coding. I need both guidance and time to master this unfamiliar area. A recurring challenge I've observed is that under tight deadlines and heavy workloads, there's a tendency to prioritize output over a thorough understanding of the material. This often leads to a superficial grasp of the concepts and suboptimal results. Typically, the focus is on merely completing tasks rather than truly dedicating the effort needed for complete mastery. I have been keen on joining since my first semester, but regrettably, by the time I had finished my courses, the selection process was already over.
