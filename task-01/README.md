# 🧙‍♂️:Terminal Wizard:
I thoroughly enjoyed tackling this task. The initial steps were clear, but I hit a snag when it came to pushing my progress to GitHub. The concept was unfamiliar, and I hesitated, fearing potential errors from venturing into unknown territory. After some contemplation, I opted to seek guidance, and to my surprise, it turned out to be a simple and swift process.

Returning to this task after completing a few others, I find myself appreciating it even more. It served as an excellent introduction to basic terminal commands, as the task's readme had suggested. Initially, the significance of this wasn't entirely clear to me, but now I grasp the importance of leveraging online resources for learning and resolving challenges.👍
